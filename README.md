# EMH eBZD SML decoder for Arduino

## Quick and dirty SML (Smart Meter Language) decoder and MQTT transmitter for the EMH eBZD smart meter.

- Tested only with Arduino MEGA
- Tested only with ENC28J60 Phy

Special decoder for the eBZD "BezugszÃ¤hler" 1 EMH00 with IR data port. When capturing the messages from this smart meter I noticed a small difference to the other meters. The payload is not fixed in length (and padded with zeros), so I had to find the start and end of the payload myself with different, non-changing data fields. 
This works quite well, but so far the code cannot detect if its just reading the meter value or if the current power display and output is unlocked via PIN. 

## Please use the 64bit version, since there will be decode errors if your energy reader is >= 429496kWh (32bit max 0xFFFFFFFF x 0.1Wh resolution = 429496,7295kWh)

The decoder works without the power (watt) output but you have to fiddle around to transmit the decoded values if you just want the energy meter (e.g. if after a blackout the meter is locked again...).  The "parse"-function returns a 0 for no successful decode, a 1 for just the energy decoded and a 3 for both energy and power decoded, but if you use "if(validData >= 1)" in the sketch it might send the same energy reading multiple times before successfully decode the power in the message buffer.
I'm currently working on an "unlock function" so the Arduino will "blink" the PIN into the meter after a blackout (if no power reading is avaiable anymore).
